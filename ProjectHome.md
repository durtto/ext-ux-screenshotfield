## Ext.ux.form.ScreenshotField 2.0 ##

---


This is a component that now merges functionality from two other [ExtJs](http://www.extjs.com) extensions into a single form field for :
<br /><br />
**1.** Uploading screenshots (picture files) in situations where you need a visual preview of the file you just uploaded; e.g passport upload in bio-data forms.
<br />**2.** Browsing for and selecting a screenshot from a remote location
<br /><br />
